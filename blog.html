    <p>Local Storage and session storage : The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, 
        
        whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

    <p>Global scope and block scope : Global scope is anything located outside of a function.

        Local scope is a variable inside of a function that can only be accessed from that function. You can’t access this variable outside of it unless it is declared in the global scope.</p>

        <p>Javascript event loop : The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

            Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.</p>
