    <p>Local Storage and session storage : The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, 
        
        whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.</p>
    <p>Global scope and block scope : Global scope is anything located outside of a function.

        Local scope is a variable inside of a function that can only be accessed from that function. You canâ€™t access this variable outside of it unless it is declared in the global scope.</p>
